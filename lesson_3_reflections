When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Thought:I would like to use remote repository when am sure it is correct and has no bugs and ready to allow others view.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thought:Manual pulling gives you more control and helps you organise your work better while automatic pulling gives less control.
